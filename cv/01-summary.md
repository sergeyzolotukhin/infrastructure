#### Summary

Experienced Software engineer with over 19 years of experience
in software development includes defining requirements, designing the architecture, writing code,
testing, deployment and maintenance.

During this time, I have engaged with a number of different programming languages (Java, Groovy, C++, PL/SQL, JavaScript, Shell scripts, and so on),
frameworks, and techniques, however, my main expertise remains in the Java language ecosystem (Microservices, Spring Boot, Hibernate and so on).
Also, I have a deep practical experience working with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL).

Also, I have deep Knowledge and practical experience with Linux-based operating systems and containerization technologies like Docker, Docker Compose (Cgroups, Namespaces)
Also, I have small practical experience with front-end development using technologies like React/Redux, Websockets, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I was lucky to work on a variety of projects, starting from small startups and up to big multiteam projects.
I have communicated and worked with colleagues from different countries.

On most of the projects where I was worked, we was responsible to DevOps activity and provisioning and deployment to production environments.
As a result, I got a lot of expirences with corresponding tools (Jenkins, GitHab Actions, Ansible, Shell script, Liquibase, Prometheus, Grafana and so on).

I love to follow best practices, patterns and architecture styles, includes OOP SOLID, GOF, GRASP, EIP, Clean Code, DDD, CQRS, Microservice and so on.
I like XP practices, including TDD and BDD.
But I strictly trust the following phrase "the best code is a code that is not written".
Also, I am a strictly goal-oriented guy (business value), 
I completely disagree with overengineering without a business or a technical justifications.

As a hobby, I like to play with cloud technologies, includes Kubernetes, Aws EC2, S3, VPC, ECS and so on.
