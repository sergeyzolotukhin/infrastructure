#### Summary

Experienced software engineer with over 19 years of experience in software development, including
defining requirements, designing architecture, writing code, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
During this time, I have worked with a range of programming languages (Java, Groovy, C++, PL/SQL,
JavaScript, shell scripts, and others), frameworks, and techniques. However, my main expertise
remains within the Java ecosystem (microservices, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and so on) with a significant
portion of my career dedicated to the banking and energy sectors.

I also have deep practical experience working with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL). I have
strong knowledge and hands-on experience with Linux-based operating systems and containerization
technologies such as Docker and Docker Compose (cgroups, namespaces). I also have some practical
experience in front-end development using technologies like React/Redux, WebSockets, HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects, from small startups to large
multi-team systems, collaborating with colleagues from different countries.

On most projects I worked on, we were responsible for DevOps activities, including provisioning and
deploying to production environments. As a result, I gained extensive experience with related tools
(Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Ansible, shell scripting, Liquibase, Prometheus, Grafana, and so on).

I follow best practices, patterns, and architectural styles, including OOP, SOLID, GoF, GRASP, EIP, Clean
Code, DDD, CQRS, microservices, and others. I also value XP practices, including TDD and BDD. At the
same time, I strongly believe in the principle: “the best code is the code that is not written.” I am highly
goal-oriented and focused on delivering business value, and I strongly disagree with overengineering
without clear business or technical justification.

As a hobby, I enjoy experimenting with cloud technologies, including Kubernetes, AWS EC2, S3, VPC,
ECS, and others.
