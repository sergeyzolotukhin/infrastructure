#### Summary

Experienced Software engineer with over 19 years’ experience 
in software development includes defining requirements, designing the architecture, writing code, 
testing, deployment and maintenance.

During this time I have engaged with a number of different programming languages (Java, Groovy, C++, PLSQL, JavaScript, Shell scripts and so om), 
frameworks, and techniques, however, my main expertise remains in the Java language ecosystem (Spring Boot, ORM - Hibernate).
Also, I have a deep practical experience working with SQL databases (PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL).

Also, I have deep Knowledge and practical experience with Linux based operation system and containerization technologies like Docker, Docker Compose (Cgroups, Namespaces)
Also, I have small practical experience with front-end development using technologies like React/Redux, Websockets, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I was lucky to work on a variety of projects, starting from small startups and up to big multiteam projects.
I have communicated and worked with colleagues from differnt countries.

On most of the projects where I was worked, we was responsible to DevOps activity and provisioning and deployment to production environments. 
As result, I got a lot of expirences with corresponding tools (Jenkins, GitHab Actions, Ansible, Shell script, Liquibase, Prometheus, Grafana and so on). 

I love to follow a best practices, patterns and architecture styles includes GOF, GRASP, EIP, Clean Code, DDD, CQRS, Microservice and so on. 
But I strictly trust at the following phrase "the best code is a code that is not written".

As a hobby, I like to play with the cloud technologies includes Kubernetes, Aws EC2, S3, VPC, ECS and so on.
